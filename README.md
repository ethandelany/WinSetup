# WinSetup
A setup script to cleanup Windows, just how I like it.

Before execution, you are required to change the Execution Policy:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

Then open a powershell window, navigate to the directory using:
`Set-Location -Path C:\blahblah`
and execute the script! It'll ask you for multiple options andsome of them probably don't work right now, but meh.
